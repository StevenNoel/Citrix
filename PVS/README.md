# Get-PVS-Targets.ps1

This script is used to get a list of all PVS target devices.

I would recommend scheduling this script to run as a scheduled task every morning.  This can be useful for auditing/historic reporting.


# PVS-HostingConnection-CredUpdate.ps1

This script can be used to change all PVS Hosting Connections passwords.  If you need to peform password changes on your Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktop Hosting Connections (Ex: XenServer, VMware, etc...).  Then the PVS Hosting connections will need to get updated as well.
